# Network-Protocol-Verification-Tool
A multi-purpose network management tool written in python that checks network protocols in use, where it analyzes BGP and checks for S-ARP, TLS, SSL, and IPsec. It also tests the robustness of the network by simulating an ARP spoofing attack and performs a vulnerability scan using Nmap.
